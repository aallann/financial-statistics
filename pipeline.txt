TODO List:

    -> Think through data cleaning: PPU chopping, look at fat tails
    -> Quantities with statistical relevance through proportional contribution to aggragate traded Quantities
    -> Build networks:      
                            - Aggregate, continent/region wise, subregion wise; 
                            - country wise if it is intelligible;
                            - build temporal network from time series data * [MOST IMPORTANT].
